#Fifer

##A lightweight conductor for the HTML5 Audio API with Flash Fallback.

**Author:** *Joe Harlow* (<joe@f5.io>)

---

`Fifer` provides a conductor for handling the use of the HTML5 `Audio API` in your application or game. Where the HTML5 `Audio API` is not available a lightweight (~4kb) Flash fallback is used.

`Fifer` works best with `mp3`s as its main file type, while providing `ogg` fallbacks for Mozilla Firefox.

###Browser Support
---

`Fifer` is built on the `HTML5 Audio API`, and will attempt to preload audio files. `Mobile Safari` will not allow the preloading of audio files, however, `Fifer` will degrade gracefully and will work to some extent.

`Fifer` also provides a lightweight Flash fallback where the `Audio API` is not available. The Flash fallback requires at least `Flash Player 11.1`.

`Fifer` will use the HTML5 `Audio API` in the following browsers:

- Microsoft Internet Explorer 9+
- Mozilla Firefox 21.0+
- Google Chrome 27.0+
- Apple Safari 5.1+
- Opera 15.0+

`Fifer` will fallback to Flash in older browsers.


###Installation
---

`Fifer` can be installed with `bower`, by running:

`bower install fifer`

###Usage
---

`Fifer` can be accessed using either `Fifer` or `fF`. From here on out, we will refer to it as `Fifer`.

####`Fifer`(`config /* Object */`)

`Fifer` itself is a function object. Calling `Fifer`(`config`) will set the global variables and return itself to enable chaining of functionality.

The `config` object can have the following properties:

- #####`force` (`boolean`)
	Setting `force` to true will force the use of the Flash fallback in all instances.
	
	Default: `false`.
- #####`swf` (`String`)
	The path that the Flash fallback is available from relative to your document root.
	
	Default: `../lib/fifer.fallback.swf`.

#####Example

    Fifer({
	    force: true, // force the use of the Flash fallback
	    swf: 'fifer/fifer.fallback.swf' // set path to Flash fallback swf
    });
    
###Methods (chainable)
---

####`loaded`(`fn /* Function */`)

The `Function` passed into the `loaded` method will be fired whenever all files in the file stack are preloaded. The first argument passed into `fn` will be the file stack from `Fifer`, `Fifer` also will be passed into the `scope` of `fn`.

#####Example

    Fifer.loaded(function(files){
		console.log(files); // logs out the file stack
	});

####`registerAudio`(`name /* String */`,`path /* String */`[, `playMultiple /* boolean : false */`])

The `registerAudio` method is used to register an audio file with `Fifer`. Once a file is registered, it is immediately preloaded from the `path` argument. The `playMultiple` argument dictates whether a file can have multiple instances played at the same time. `playMultiple` is an optional argument and defaults to false.

`Fifer` is extended with a `Function` called by the `name` argument where possible (ie. where the `name` does not conflict with a `Fifer` method). When called this `Function` will play the file.

Calling `registerAudio` later in your application where the `loaded` `Function` has already been called will cause `loaded` to be called again.

**N.B. To support Mozilla Firefox, `Fifer` requires both the standard `mp3` format files, along with `ogg` fallbacks. The files should be named exactly the same and in the same location. This fallback is automatic.**

#####Example

    Fifer
        .loaded(function(files){
	    	console.log(files); // logs out the file stack
	    	this.bang(); // play the bang file once it's loaded
	    })
	    .registerAudio('bang', 'bang.mp3', true);
	    
####`play`(`name /* String */`[,`loop /* boolean : false */`, `ended /* Function */`])

The `play` method will play the audio file determined by it's name in the file stack. Providing a `loop` argument will allow you to set the file to loop indefinitely. The `ended` Function is an optional callback for when the audio file has finished playing.

#####Example

    Fifer
    	/* The audio file mapped to 'bang' will be
    	   played and looped indefinitely */
        .play('bang', true);
        
The same can be achieved with the following:

	Fifer
    	/* The audio file mapped to 'bang' will be
    	   played and looped indefinitely */
        .bang(true);

####`stop`([`name /* String */`])

If a `name` argument is provided, the `stop` method will stop all playing instances of that audio file.

If no `name` argument is provided, all currently playing audio will stop.

#####Example

    Fifer.stop('bang'); // will stop only playing instances of 'bang'
    Fifer.stop(); // will stop all playing audio


####`stopAll`()

The `stopAll` method will stop all currently playing audio.

#####Example

    Fifer.stopAll(); // will stop all playing audio

####`mute`([`name /* String */`])

If a `name` argument is provided, the `mute` method will mute all playing instances of that audio file. 

If no `name` argument is provided, all audio in the file stack will be muted until unmuted.

**If a file is called to play while it is registered as muted, it will play muted.**

#####Example

    Fifer.mute('bang'); // all instances of 'bang' will be muted until unmuted
    Fifer.mute(); // will mute all audio until unmuted
    
####`muteAll`()

The `muteAll` method will mute all audio in the stack until unmuted.

#####Example

    Fifer.muteAll(); // will mute all audio until unmuted
    
####`unmute`([`name /* String */`])

If a `name` argument is provided, the `unmute` method will unmute all instances of that audio file. 

If no `name` argument is provided, all audio in the file stack will be unmuted.

#####Example

    Fifer.unmute('bang'); // all instances of 'bang' will be unmuted
    Fifer.unmute(); // will unmute all audio in the file stack
    
####`unmuteAll`()

The `unmuteAll` method will unmute all audio in the stack.

#####Example

    Fifer.unmuteAll(); // will unmute all audio in the file stack

####`isPlaying`([`name /* String */`])

If a `name` argument is provided, it will check to see if a specific file is playing and return a boolean.

If no `name` argument is provided, it will return a boolean showing if `Fifer` is currently playing *any* audio file.

#####Example

   Fifer.isPlaying('bang'); // will return true if the audio file registered as bang is playing

####`onAudioProcess`([`fn /* Function */`])

The `fn` argument will be called when audio is processed, either using `AudioContext` or Flash's native `computeSpectrum`. An array of values will be passed to Function containing Byte Frequency data from the audio stream.

*Due to a [bug](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13958158/why-arent-safari-or-firefox-able-to-process-audio-data-from-mediaelementsource) in Safari's handling of analyzing a MediaElementSource, Safari currently reports the array passed to the Function as empty (0) values*

#####Example

   Fifer.onAudioProcess(function(arr) {
       console.log(arr);
   });
    
####`!dynamic!`([`loop /* boolean : false */`, `ended /* Function */`])

Once a file has been registered with `Fifer` and it has preloaded, `Fifer` will be extended with a `Function` named after that file.

Calling this dynamic `Function` will play the file. It will also take a `loop` parameter to allow indefinite looping of the file and an `ended` callback for when the audio file has finished playing.

#####Example

    Fifer.loaded(function(files){
    		/* Fifer is extended with a Function called 'aReallyLongNameThingimajig' */
	    	this.aReallyLongNameThingimajig(true); // play the 'aReallyLongNameThingimajig' file and loop indefinitely
	    })
	    .registerAudio('aReallyLongNameThingimajig', 'test.mp3', true);
